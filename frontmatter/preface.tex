My time at the University of Michigan has unequivocally been the most enjoyable year out of my life. Both in terms of the friends I made and the stellar supervision from the MDO Lab, with special thanks to Bernardo. I also want to thank Maurice for being so incredibly understanding and always having useful feedback. I honestly could not have asked for a better thesis supervisor. Lastly, I obviously could not have done any of this without the help and support of my friends and family. Even the shortest talks or signs of support meant a huge deal to me. The list is too long to include here but anybody in my direct environment will know who I am talking about, ranging from colleagues, roommates and fellow rowers in Michigan and Delft to high school friends to other people I had the privilege of meeting during my 64 months as a student.

I have genuinely enjoyed diving into the world of Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation, and facing the adversities that I came across. As Bernardo once told me: \textit{Us integrators and framework developers are in the uncomfortable position of working with the models given to us and deal with their flaws.}
